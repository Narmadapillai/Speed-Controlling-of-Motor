# Speed-Controlling-of-Motor

OBJECTIVE: To use PWM signal generated with 555 timer IC to control a Motor using L298N motor driver.

ABSTRACT: The aim of development of this project is towards providing efficient and simple method for control speed of DC motor using pulse width modulation technique.
There are several methods for controlling the speed of DC motors. One simple method is to add series resistance using a rheostat as considerable power is consumed in the rheostat, this method is not economical. Another method is to use a series switch that can be closed or opened rapidly. This type of control is termed as chopper control. The PWM based chopper circuit smoothly controls the speed of general purpose DC motors.

APPROACH/METHODOLOGY:

Speed control of a motor can be achieved through various methods, depending on the type of motor, application, and control requirements. Below are some common methodologies for controlling the speed of a motor:

1.	Voltage Control:

a.	Voltage Regulation: By varying the voltage supplied to the motor, you can control its speed. Lowering the voltage decreases the speed, while increasing it speeds up the motor.

b.	Auto-Transformer: Using an auto-transformer to tap different voltage levels and supply them to the motor.

2.	Frequency Control:

a.	Frequency Drives (VFD):VFD are commonly used to control the speed of AC induction motors. They vary the frequency of the input power, which in turn changes the motor's speed.

3.	Slip Control:

a.Rotor Resistance Control: In wound-rotor induction motors, you can vary the rotor resistance to control speed.

4.	Pole Changing:

a.Multi-speed Motors: Some motors have multiple windings or stator pole configurations that can be switched to change the number of poles and, consequently, the speed.

5.	Mechanical Methods:

a.	Gearboxes: Using gearboxes to change the mechanical transmission ratio can control the motor's output speed.
 
b.	Pulley and Belt Systems: A pulley and belt system can be used to transmit motion between the motor and the load with varying pulley sizes for speed control.

6.	Electronic Control:

a.	Microcontroller/PID Control: Use a microcontroller or a programmable logic controller (PLC) to control the motor's speed by adjusting the input voltage or frequency based on feedback from sensors like encoders or tachometers. PID (Proportional-Integral- Derivative) controllers are commonly used for precise speed control.

b.	PWM (Pulse Width Modulation): By rapidly switching the motor's power supply on and off, you can control the effective voltage and, consequently, the motor speed.

7.	Sensorless Control:

a.	Sensorless Control Algorithms: Modern motor control techniques can estimate the rotor position and speed without sensors. These algorithms are often used in applications like brushless DC (BLDC) motors and some types of AC motors.

8.	Hydraulic Control:

a.Hydraulic Motors: In hydraulic systems, you can control the speed by adjusting the flow rate or pressure of the hydraulic fluid.

9.	Mechanical Braking:

a.Dynamic Braking: In some cases, you can control the motor's speed by applying mechanical brakes to the system to slow it down.

10.	Electronic Inverter:

a.	Inverter-Based Control: Inverters are used in some types of motors to control speed.
By varying the output voltage and frequency, you can achieve precise control.

The choice of speed control methodology depends on factors such as motor type, cost, efficiency, precision, and the specific requirements of the application. Modern applications often use electronic control methods, such as VFDs and microcontroller- based systems, for their flexibility and precision.
